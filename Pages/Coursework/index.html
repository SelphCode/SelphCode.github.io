		<h3>Japanese, Math, and Fiction Writing:</h3>
	<div class="article column1"><p><h4>Japanese I & II</h4><hr><p>Before Japanese Class: I didn't think I knew much Japanese. I thought I would be socially-anxious or disorganized and present myself poorly. I expected to be overwhelmed.</p><p>After Japanese Class: I realized I knew more Japanese than I thought. Or maybe the logic was overwhelmingly sensible to me.</p><p> Learning Japanese made me even more excited about learning all of the languages of the Pacific Rim region, especially Hangeul and Cantonese.</p> <p> I got an A in both classes!<br><p><i>HAI!</i></p>
	</div>
	<div class="article column2">
		<p> <h4>Calculus 3 </h4>
		<hr><p>Before the class I thought I could easily review the syllabus and easily prepare for the course by preparing for the lectures.</p> <p> After the class I came to understand that I would have felt better prepared if I had prepared for the bulk of the course in advance of the semester.</p><p>Thankfully, the topic of decision making has always interested me. I can't wait to revisit the material.</p></div>
<div class="article column3"><p>
		<h4>Fiction Writing</h4>
		<hr><p>Sometimes I want to be an author so badly, I can almost taste the ink.</p><p>Before the class, I was over-confident that I could produce material and peer review others stories capably.</p>
		<p>Now that the class is over, I just want to take it again-- and the prerequisities.</p><p>I got a great grade, but I felt that spending ten years between creative writing classes was too much time spent lacking in the appropriate exchange of literary vocabulary.</p><p>Needless to say, I was rapt when it came to my professor's and my peers' analyses and opinions,</p><p>but I felt discombobulated when the opportunity came for me to return the favor.</p>

	<h3>Programming:</h3>

		<div class="article column1"><p><h4>HTML</h4><hr><p>I have always enjoyed feeling like I can "program" because I could understand BASIC and use intuitive HTML tags.</p><p>This course has shown me that HTML has changed a lot since I was first introduced to it.</p> </div>
		<div class="article column2"><p> <h4>CSS</h4><hr><p>Before the class, I thought that CSS seemed intimidating. Now I can say that it doesn't seem any more threatening than a "Blink" element nested in a "Marquee" tag.</p></div>
		<div class="article column3"><p>
		<h4>Javascript</h4>
		<hr><p>The class hasn't covered this topic yet, and I'm a bit nervous that it will feel overwhelming! There's already been a lot of material, but I'm looking forward to the Javascript portion.
