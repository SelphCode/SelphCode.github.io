		<p>I love math and science because they work together to tell a more complete story than what is often celebrated, popularized, or generally accepted. </p><p>These stories can lead to implementable solutions. I hope to be one of many able to lead the way.</p>
		<p>
			I hope to get a PhD in Cosmology someday. </p><p>Right now, I'm working on an undergraduate degree in math and science.</p>
		<p>I look forward to gaining skill with programming so that I can best use current technology in the analysis of emergent astronomical data.</p>

		<h2>Three things to always consider</h2></div>

	<div id="main-content">
		<p>
		<h2>Historical Record Analysis <br><i>and</i><br> Popular Culture Education</h2>
		<p>Why do studies show what studies show and who does the studies?</p>
		<p>Science and society have you to defend them. And in return, they help you fight back against a dissatisfying existence.
			Why does it seem that we don't get conflicts to resolve?</p>
<p><h2>Conscientious Consumption, Logic, Science <br><i>and</i><br> Interrelationship Economics</h2>
			<p>There are ways to track what happens to your food before you get it. Could it be in society's best interests <i>not</i> to know?</p>
			<p>It's exhausting- but relieving, to take more control over influence and existence. It just feels good to try to be as responsible as one is capable of being.</p>
<p><h2>Underserved Communities <br><i>and</i><br>Oppressed Populations</h2><p>Some societies or individuals seem to have a harder time than others.</p>
			<p>Helping out is the only right answer. The hard questions are more philosophical. How? When? and Why <i>again</i>?</p>
