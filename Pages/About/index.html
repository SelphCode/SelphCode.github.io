			I hope to get a PhD in Cosmology. Right now, I'm working on an undergraduate degree in math and science.</p>
	<p>I look forward to gaining skill with programming so that I can best use current technology in the analysis of emergent astronomical data.</p>
</div>

	<h3>Three things I think are important to always consider:</h3><div id="content"><div id="commentary">

	<div class="article column1"><p><h4>Historical Record Analysis <br><i>and</i><br> Popular Culture Education</h4><hr><p>Why do studies show what studies show and who does the studies?</p>
		<p>Science and society have you to defend them. And in return, they help you fight back against a dissatisfying existence. <br><br>Why does it seem that we don't get conflicts to resolve?</p></div>
		<div class="clear"> </div>

		<div class="article column2"><p><h4>Conscientious Consumption, Logic, Science <br><i>and</i><br> Interrelationship Economics</h4>
			<hr><p>There's ways to track what happens to your food before you get it. Could it be in society's best interests <i>not</i> to know?</p>
			<p>It's exhausting- but relieving, to take more control over influence and existence. It just feels good to try to be as responsible as one is capable of being.</p> </div>
	<div class="clear"> </div>

		<div class="article column3"><p><h4>Underserved Communities <br><i>and</i><br>Oppressed Populations</h4><hr><p>Some societies or individuals seem to have a harder time than others.</p>
			<p>Helping out is the only right answer. The hard questions are more philosophical. How? When? and Why <i>again</i>?</p>
		</div>
	<div class="clear"> </div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I love math and science because they work together to tell a more complete story than what is often celebrated, popularized, or generally accepted. </p><p>These stories can lead to implementable solutions. I hope to be one of many able to lead the way.</p>
