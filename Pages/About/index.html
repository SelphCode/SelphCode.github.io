			<h2>About Selph</h2>
			<p>I love math and science because they work together to tell a more complete story than what is often celebrated, popularized, or generally accepted. </p>
			<p>These stories can lead to implementable solutions. I hope to be one of many able to lead the way.</p>
			<h2>Goal: a PhD in Cosmology</h2>
			<p>Right now, I'm working on an undergraduate degree in math and science at Bellevue College.</p>
			<p>Professionally, I look forward to gaining skill with programming so that I can best use current technology in the analysis of emergent astronomical data. Magnetohydrodynamics and mathematical physics are interesting to me!</p>


			<h2>Three things to always consider</h2>
			<ul><li>Historical Record Analysis</li><li> Popular Culture Education</li></ul>
			<p>Why do studies show what studies show and who does the studies?

				Science and society have you to defend them. And in return, they help you fight back against a dissatisfying existence. Why does it seem that we don't get conflicts to resolve?</p>
			<ul><li>Conscientious Consumption, Logic, Science</li>
				<li>  Interrelationship Economics</li></ul>
			<p>There are ways to track what happens to your food before you get it. Could it be in society's best interests <i>not</i> to know?</p>
			<p>It's exhausting- but relieving, to take more control over influence and existence. It just feels good to try to be as responsible as one is capable of being.</p>
			<ul><li>Underserved Communities </li><li>Oppressed Populations</li></ul>
			<p>Some societies or individuals seem to have a harder time than others.</p>
			<p>Helping out is the only right answer. The hard questions are more philosophical. How? When? and Why "again"?</p>
