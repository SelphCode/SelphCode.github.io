        <p>New Skills</p><p>I wasn't very confident with my ability to claim any coding skills before I started this module. I was surprised when I felt things were easily understandable, and grateful that so many people were embarking on a similar journey to mine. This module showed me that the time spent reading code and cleaning code is just as valid as the time spent writing it. All the time spent makes one better at the task.</p>

        <p>New Tools</p><p>This module also gave me the opportunities to try out resources at my classmtes' suggestions. My peers recommended online resources that helped me understand the material covered in this week's module. It's easy to see how things can get incredibly complex behind the scenes!</p>

        <p>Comments</p> <p>Discussion board interaction assignments were incredibly helpful. I'm grateful when the announcements for new posts come through. It makes the class feel vibrant!</p>
