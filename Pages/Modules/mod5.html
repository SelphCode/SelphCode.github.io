        <p>New Skills</p><p>This module showed me that the time spent reading code and cleaning code is just as valid as the time spent writing it. All the time spent makes one better at the task. Researchign and reading about the code is just as important as writing it.</p>

    <div class="article column2">
        <p>New Tools</p><p>This module also gave me the opportunities to try out new tools at my classmates' suggestions. My peers recommended online resources that helped me understand the material covered in this week's module. It's easy to see how things can get incredibly complex behind the scenes!</p>
