<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href="">English estate gardens</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>

<h2>What topics covered provided me with new knowledge...?</h2>
<p>The number of different ways to use CSS to affect the same area of screen space really impressed and puzzled me. I found various ways of adjusting things that still didn't seem to display as intended on my screen. </p>
<h2>Which tools support my new skills?</h2>
<p>The homework and classwork have given me the motivation I needed to muddle through the difficult problems that would normally feel too nuanced to approach. The guidance provided in the recommended and required coursework, as well as the resources shared, helped me to feel more confident when investigating code and considering design elements.  I also really appreciated the ability to revert to earlier builds in WebStorm, the open-source software I've been using- along with github- to make my site and pages sync together.</p>
