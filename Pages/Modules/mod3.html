<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href="">English estate gardens</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>

<h2>What topics covered provided me with new knowledge...?</h2>
<p>The number of different ways to use CSS to affect the same area of screen space really impressed and puzzled me. I found various ways of adjusting things that still didn't seem to display as intended on my screen. </p>
<h2>Which tools support my new skills?</h2>
<p>The homework and classwork have given me the motivation I needed to muddle through the difficult problems that would normally feel to nuanced to approach. I really appreciated the ability to revert to earlier builds in WebStorm, the open-source Software I've been using with github to make my site and pages sync together.</p>
